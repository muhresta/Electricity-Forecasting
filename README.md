US Energy Generation 2001-2022 Dataset is a collection of net electricity generation of U.S and it's states in a time series format. This analysis helps us to identify market share, market growth, trends, and comparison of US states and other sectors in energy generation, and gain the understanding future of net generation which represents future of US national energy consumption.

Independent project for building my portofolio. This dataset has taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kevinmorgado/us-energy-generation-2001-2022) according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (Sep 2021).
